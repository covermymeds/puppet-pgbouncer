# === Parameters 
# 
# userlist is an empty array by default. You can create an array in hieradata 
# like the example below or you can call the resource directly from a third 
# party module 
# pgbouncer::userlist: 
#   - user: <user>
#     password: <password> 
#   - user: <user2>
#     password: <password2> 
# 
# databases is an empty array by default. You can create an array in hieradata
# like the example below or you can call the resource direclty from a third
# party module Set hieradata hash array for "pgbouncer::databases" to set values
# Example:
# pgbouncer::databases
#   - source_db: postgres
#     host: localhost
#     dest_db: postgres
#     auth_user: postgres
# 
# dbtmpfile is the temporary file the module uses to stitch together pieces
# using puppet concat.  It's located in the tmp directory by default
#
# paramtmpfile is the temporary file the module uses to stitch together pieces
# using puppet concat. Its located in the tmp directory by default.
#
# default_config_params is a hash of the necessary params needed to start
# pgbouncer. If you choose to override this, you must specify all of the default
# params and not just the one you want to override.
#
# config_params is a hash that gets merged with the default params. If you want
# to override a single value, this would be the variable to do it in. All of the
# available params found in the below link can be added to the config from this
# hash.
# Link to pgbouncer doc: http://pgbouncer.projects.pgfoundry.org/doc/config.html
# Example:
# pgbouncer::config_params:
#   port:8765
#   dns_max_ttl: 16
#
# pgbouncer_package_name is the name of the package that should be installed. By
# default, this should be picked by the OS, but you can specify a name here if 
# you'd like to override the package name. You could possibly use this to 
# specify an older version as well.
#
# conffile is the name of the configuration file
#
# userlist_file is the name of the auth_file where the userlist is stored
#
# deb_default_file is a file specific to ubuntu that loads a startup file
